# PostLake — connected accounts

Returns each connected account's `acc_…` id, platform, handle, and health
`status`. You only need this if you want to post to **specific** accounts by id —
for most posts it's simpler to skip the lookup and post to a whole `profile` by
name (see the `postlake-publish` skill). Handy here for checking which accounts
are connected and whether any show `status: "needs_reauth"` (they need
reconnecting before they can post).

## Auth

All requests use a Bearer key from the `POSTLAKE_API_KEY` environment variable:

```
Authorization: Bearer $POSTLAKE_API_KEY
```

Get a key at https://app.postlake.dev/app/keys. Base URL: `https://api.postlake.dev`.

## List connected accounts

```bash
curl https://api.postlake.dev/v1/social-accounts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $POSTLAKE_API_KEY"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "accounts": [
    { "id": "acc_84a4…", "platform": "bluesky",  "handle": "yourbrand.bsky.social", "status": "active" },
    { "id": "acc_e553…", "platform": "linkedin", "handle": "Your Name",             "status": "active" },
    { "id": "acc_54d8…", "platform": "instagram","handle": "yourbrand",             "status": "needs_reauth" }
  ]
}
```

- `status: "active"` — ready to post.
- `status: "needs_reauth"` — the connection expired; the user must reconnect it at
  https://app.postlake.dev/app/channels before posting to that account.

## Connecting new accounts

Connecting a platform is an OAuth flow a human completes in the browser. If a
platform the user wants isn't listed, tell them to connect it at
**https://app.postlake.dev/app/channels**, then re-list.

## What platforms support

To check limits/options for a platform (character limits, media rules) before
composing, call the public capabilities endpoint (no auth needed):

```bash
curl https://api.postlake.dev/v1/platforms/bluesky
```

## Tips

- Always resolve account ids from here rather than guessing.
- Skip accounts with `status: "needs_reauth"` and tell the user to reconnect.
